My name is MyungJae (Andrew) Lee. 

I post my side projects, artwork, and really anything that I want here :).

I am a University of Waterloo student studying Computer Science. I am currently interning at Facebook. I have previously interned (from most to least recent) at Zynga, Google, Hubdoc, Sony, and Telus. As for my hobbies, I love playing games, watching soccer, and reading manga.
